This is a really simple preloader for any theme.
Since WP5.2 introduced wp_body_open hook, this plugin leverages that to accomplish a simple prepend.

Easy Preloader by Jason Bruno adds a menu item under the "Settings" menu. It then asks for a URL of any image, ideally a square GIF animation to use in the preloader.

Additional functionalities like using WP file upload field and background color selection will be added really soon.
